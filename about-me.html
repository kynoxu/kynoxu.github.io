<h1 id="text"><b>About Me</b></h1>
<p id="para">My name is Gioni Antoniu Cristian Beudean, I'm 16 years old, currently living in Reading, England and i've lived here since 15.08.2015 when I moved from Romania to England.<br>
   I was born in a small town in Romania, called Bistrita-Nasaud on a rainy day of december, on 24th in the year 2000. <br><br>In Romania I studied at a school in Sieu-Magherus, a village near my home from year 1 to year 4 then I moved to a much better school in the city, Bistrita. It was an art school called "Liceul De Arte Corneliu Baba",<br> one of the best in the city, but unfortunetly I had to move back after year 7 as I wasn't able to integrate very well. I went back to my first school until 2015 when I finished year 8. In the same year, on the August 15th <br>I moved to England and I started to study at "Prospect School" until 2017 when I finished year 11 and had my GCSEs which I passed all of them apart of English. <br> <br>Now I'm studying ICT at Reading College doing Level 2 and it is my first year. After I finish this, I'm thinking about moveing to Level 3. <br>In the Future I wish to become a programmer as I love technology and I'd love to create useful softwares. </p>
