<p id="para">I'm a person passionated about a lot of things and I have many hobbies because of that. Some of them are good and will help my in life, and others are just for killing time. <br> I really have lots of them, but I'm afraid that I can't list them all here, but anyway the bigger ones are here.  </p>

<h1 id="gaming"><b>Gaming</b></h1>

<p id="para4hobby1">One of my big hobbies is gaming. I play a lot of games in my free time, but sometimes I play too much and they go over my other tasks. <br>I play most of the games on PC, and for over 90% of them I use Steam, an online gaming marketplace, to buy and download the games. <br>I started playing games when I was about 5 years old, but they became a hobby of mine after I passed the age of 11 after I discovered this amazing thing called "Internet" and after that I started playing more games and even online.  </p>

  <h1 id="Photography"><b>Photography</b></h1>
  <img id="photo"src="images/photo.png" alt="">
  <p id="para4hobby2">The art of taking pictures is one of the things I love. I do this when I see something that I like or just random things. This form of art that I love has a special place in my heart, it can say 1000 words using only one picture. <br>Taking pictures and editing them calms me down and helps me relax and I'm always proud when I see the final result being loved and appreciated by other. This allways encourage me to continue. <br>I discovered photography when I was a chield, seeing other getting a picture from a mysterious device out of nowhere, but later I was told that this amazing device is called a "camera" and later <br>my parents purchased one for me which I still have today, but I can't use it anymore due to its age. Now I'm using my phone to take pictures, and I'm thinking of buying a DSLR camera in the future, but I still need to some money for that. </p>
