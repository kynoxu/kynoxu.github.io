<p id="para">In college I have to complete different Units and this is one of them. This is Unit 1, "The Internet World" where we learn about many different things of the internet and how they work. <br>This unit was short and we finished the whole thing in less than months and after that we had to take an exam which took place on December 7th. <br><br>This was just one of the many units I'll have to complate during my year in College. I'm still waiting to see the results from the exam but those will be shown to us later this year.This unit was <br> simple and easy as it was only about learning the question and get more knowledge about inter in general. Most of the questions were basic and very common even for the untrained eye.</p>
